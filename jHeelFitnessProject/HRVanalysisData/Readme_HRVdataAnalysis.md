This code provides:

Comprehensive HRV tracking including all metrics from your data:

HRV
pNN50 and pNN20
RMSSD and SDNN
Oxygen saturation
Recovery scores


Four different visualizations:

HRV trend with average HRV baseline
PNN metrics over time
RMSSD and SDNN trends
Recovery Score correlation with HRV


Recovery state analysis based on HRV deviation from average

To use this with your actual data:

Export your Garmin Connect IQ data regularly
Format the data to match the structure
Add each session to track changes over time

The visualizations will help you:

Monitor HRV trends
Track recovery status
Identify patterns in your cardiovascular health
Optimize training based on recovery state

# This enhanced version (_modV1) includes:

Additional HRV metrics:

SD1/SD2 (Poincaré plot indices)
Frequency domain measures (VLF, LF, HF)
Normalized units (LF n.u., HF n.u.)
LF/HF ratio for autonomic balance


Comprehensive visualizations:

Poincaré plot indices trends
Frequency domain measures
Autonomic balance
Normalized units
Time domain measures
Heart rate and RR intervals


Advanced analysis including:

Autonomic balance assessment
Stress level evaluation
Recovery status



To use this with your Garmin data:

Export your detailed HRV data
Format it according to the structure
Add sessions regularly to track changes

The visualizations and analysis will help you:

Monitor autonomic nervous system balance
Track stress levels
Assess recovery status
Optimize training based on HRV patterns



####################################
A typical recovery score in HRV tracking would usually be a composite metric calculated from multiple HRV-related parameters like:

HRV value
RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)
pNN50 (Percentage of NN intervals differing by more than 50ms)
SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals)
Current HRV compared to baseline
