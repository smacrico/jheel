The HR-RS Deviation Index is likely a measure of heart rate variability, which is a crucial metric for understanding the autonomic nervous system and overall 
cardiovascular health.
To further calculate HRV using Python, you would ideally need access to the raw R-R interval data (the time between consecutive heartbeats) 
from your Garmin Forerunner 245 watch. This data is not explicitly shown in the summary, but is typically available in the detailed Garmin FIT file 
for the activity.
Some additional data that would be helpful for HRV analysis include:

Heart rate data (in beats per minute) at a high sampling rate (e.g. 1Hz or higher)
Timestamp data for each heart rate measurement
Any other physiological signals recorded by the watch (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope) that could help with artifact removal and data quality analysis.

With the R-R interval data and potentially the additional signals, you can then use Python libraries like biosppy, hrv, or pyhrv to calculate various time-domain, 
frequency-domain, and non-linear HRV metrics. These can provide valuable insights into your training load, recovery status, and overall cardiovascular health.

Training zones calculation based on Running Economy

To use this with your actual data, you would:

                Export your Garmin data regularly
                Format it to match the required structure
                Add each session to the analysis
                Generate visualizations to track progress

The visualizations will help you:

                Identify trends in your running efficiency
                Spot correlations between different metrics
                Track improvements over time
                Plan training intensities based on your zones
