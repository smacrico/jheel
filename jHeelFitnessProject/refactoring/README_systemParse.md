To use this system:

Install required packages:

bashCopypip install fitparse pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn

Directory structure:

Copyyour_project/
├── fit_files/           # Store your .fit files here
├── processed_data/      # Processed CSV files
└── hrv_analysis.py      # The main script

The system provides:


FIT file parsing
HRV metrics calculation

Time domain (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50)
Frequency domain (VLF, LF, HF)
Poincaré plot indices (SD1, SD2)


Data storage and retrieval
Comprehensive visualizations
Trend analysis


To analyze your data:

pythonCopy# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = HRVAnalyzer()

# Process your FIT files
analyzer.process_directory("path/to/your/fit/files")

# Save processed data
analyzer.save_database("hrv_database.csv")

# Load existing database
analyzer.load_database("hrv_database.csv")
Would you like me to:

Add additional metrics or analysis methods?
Explain any specific part of the code in more detail?
Add more visualization options?
Include additional statistical analysis features?
