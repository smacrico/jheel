To use this dashboard:

Save this as an HTML file
Replace the csvData constant with your actual CSV data string
Serve it through a web server (local or hosted)

The dashboard features:

A Sleep & HRV dual-axis line chart showing trends over time
A radar chart showing current recovery status across six dimensions
A scatter plot showing training load balance with color-coded points based on ramp rate
Date range filtering functionality
Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
Interactive tooltips and hover effects

You'll need to:

Add error handling for missing or invalid data
Implement the date filtering functionality
Add any additional interactive features you want
Customize the styling to match your preferences
Add any additional metrics or visualizations you might want to include

The charts are all interactive by default, allowing users to:

Hover over data points to see exact values
Click on legend items to show/hide datasets
Zoom and pan on the charts
Export the charts as images

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail or add any specific features to the dashboard?
